    "__Overview:__  As every data scientist/machine learning engineer should do before creating and testing a model, I extensively analyzed the data at hand. First, I analyzed the data distribution for each numerical variable. From here, several conclusions were made (such as the facts that most top 50 songs tend to lack instrumentalness and acousticness, possess higher levels of danceability and energy, have an average length of around 3 minutes and 20 seconds, and more). Then, I viewed the variables' correlation with each other (which helped determine what variables to use in my models). After that, I made various graphs of total streams versus song lengths and concluded that popular songs don't necessarily have shorter song lengths. Finally, I created a dashboard of the week-to-week changes in average song characteristics for all weekly charts since 2017. To do so, I normalized all variables that were not on a 0-1 scale, converted my data table from a wide format to a long format (from each observation being a song to now being the individual weekly streams for a song), grouped and averaged my data for each week, and used Plotly to create the dashboard. The dashboard provides numerous conclusions about popular music, and several key highlights include the following: acoustic-oriented music has been slowly rising since its low point in 2018 (when rap/trap music dominated the charts), speechiness levels slightly lowered since the pandemic started thanks to the increasing popularity of non-rap pop music on the streaming charts (also likely due to TikTok becoming the primary platform for emerging music trends as opposed to SoundCloud which is more associated with rap), superstar artists (such as Adele, Drake, and Taylor Swift) can afford to release albums with songs that have longer-than-usual song lengths and still achieve massive success, and more!\n",
